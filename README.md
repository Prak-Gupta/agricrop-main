## Abstract
In today’s time technology is playing a vital role
in different sectors to overcome the difficulties and to have
better and maximum results. In India, the farming sector has a
huge impact on Indian economy. Half of the country’s
population is still employed in the agriculture sector.
Agriculture industry is largely influenced by natural
conditions of its surroundings and hence faces number of
challenges in actual farming practices. Agriculture practices in
the country are largely primitive and technological change in
the sector is slow. Effective technology can be used to increase
the yield and to reduce the maximum possible challenges in
this field. Most of the times it is observed that farmers tend to
sow the crop according to its market value and possible
financial profits rather than taking factors like soil conditions,
sustainability etc. in to the account. This may lead to
undesirable results for farmers and for the nature of soil too.
In today’s time, technologies like machine learning and deep
learning can become game changers in such fields if they are
used in a proper manner. This project will represent an effective
use of such technologies in order to provide maximum
assistance to farmers in the area of crop recommendation.


## Problem Statement☘️
- Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a country’s economic growth. 

- In country like India, majority of the population is dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Many new technologies, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are being implemented into agriculture so that it is easier for farmers to grow and maximize their yield. 

- In this project, We present a website in which the following applications are implemented; Crop recommendation, Fertilizer recommendation and respectively.

- I have also made some visuals about the production of a crop/fruit for the total year of production,and the states which are contributing the most for a particular crop/fruit 

    - In the crop recommendation application, the user can provide the soil data from their side and the application will predict which crop should the user grow. 
    
    - For the fertilizer recommendation application, the user can input the soil data and the type of crop they are growing, and the application will predict what the soil lacks or has excess of and will recommend improvements.
